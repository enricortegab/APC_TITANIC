# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains a solution to the classic Titanic survival prediction problem using Machine Learning. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on available features.

## Dataset

The dataset is provided by [Kaggle's Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes information such as:

- Passenger class (Pclass)
- Name, Sex, Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)
- Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)
- Ticket number and fare (Fare)
- Cabin (if available)
- Port of embarkation (Embarked)

## Model Selection

Several machine learning models are tested, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- ROC-AUC Score
